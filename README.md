## Introduction
This project sets the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) as your desktop background. It automatically adjusts the image to fit your screen resolution and applies a subtle blur effect for added aesthetic.

## ðŸ“¸ Snapshots
The script transforms your desktop with images such as:

![ Jupiter and the Geminid ](https://github.com/mhmmdbdrhmd/APOD/assets/29101930/a6e3b62b-77de-4c50-a995-0934d6593693)
*Jupiter and the Geminid*

![ The Cat's Eye Nebula in Optical and X-ray ](https://github.com/mhmmdbdrhmd/APOD/assets/29101930/34eaa7a1-ebff-45ef-83a0-b71b2953dafb)
*The Cat's Eye Nebula in Optical and X-ray*

## How It Works
The `apod.sh` script performs the following actions:
- Retrieves the current display resolution.
- Downloads the APOD image from NASA's website.
- Resizes and blurs the image to fit the desktop.
- Sets the processed image as the desktop background.
- Cleans up temporary files to maintain a tidy workspace.

## Usage
Run the script using the following command in the terminal:
```bash
./apod.sh
```
